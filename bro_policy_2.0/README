Pleae note that this set of policy is currently in flux and may be 
less predictable than the older code.  This is temporary and will 
be corrected in the next few weeks.

As well be advised that the old < 3.0 line of bro policy will be depricated
and will not be feature upgraded.  I will place the converted code into the 
repo, but please consider updating your sshd versions.
